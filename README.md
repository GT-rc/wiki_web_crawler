# wiki_web_crawler
A Wikipedia Web Crawler made with a Udemy course.

The idea behind this project is that if you continue to click on the first link of any given Wikipedia page (not including any pronunciation links or other links to pages that aren't entire Wikipedia pages) you will eventually end up at the page on Philosphy. This crawler automates the process and tells you what pages it went through to get there.

To use, simply change the 'targetUrl' variable to the page you're looking for, and optionally, you can change the 'startUrl' variable as well.

The folder 'Non-Project Files' contains files unrelated to this project.
